I am a PhD candidate in computer science at McGill University, supervised by professors Gregory Dudek and Ahmed El-Geneidy.  My PhD thesis is about training graph neural nets to plan public transit networks using reinforcement learning.  Prior to starting my PhD, I completed an M.Sc in computer science under Gregory Dudek, in which I developed a novel type of visual feature for scene recognition and localization over long distances.  I have also spent time doing computer vision research at Samsung's Montreal AI lab, and at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo under professor Helmut Prendinger, where I led a team of researchers in researching and publishing a journal paper on semantic segmentation.

My research interests include computer vision, urban planning, reinforcement learning, field robotics, graph neural networks, AI alignment, and neural learning in general.  Beyond my work in academia, I have several years of industrial experience in software development, machine learning engineering, and data science, as well as experience leading small research teams in academia.

When not engaged in research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, exploring the city of Montreal, and playing board games with friends.  I'm also an avid reader of works of fiction, history, and philosophy, especially ethics and the philosophy of mind.
