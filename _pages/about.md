My name is Andrew Holliday.  I am a PhD student at McGill University, supervised by Gregory Dudek and Ahmed El-Geneidy.  I am currently wrapping up my PhD, which is on the use of deep reinforcement learning for the design of public transit networks.  My research interests include computer vision, reinforcement learning, field robotics, graph neural networks, urban planning, AI alignment, and neural learning in general.  

Prior to starting the PhD program, I completed an M.Sc in computer science under Gregory Dudek, in which I developed a novel multi-level visual feature type for scene recognition and localization over long distances.  During this time, I also worked on several other projects involving robotic visual navigation with my colleagues Florian Shkurti, Travis Manderson, Jimmy Li, and others.

Beyond my work in academia, I have worked in industry in several roles.  For several years, I was a software developer at InMotion Technology, where I worked on applications and low-level systems for the Onboard Mobile Gateway, a rugged mobile router product designed for deployment in fleet vehicles.  Later, from 2017 to 2019 I was a machine learning consultant with Kinsol Research, working with them on several projects relating to visual object detection and time-series prediction.  There I curated datasets and designed and implemented and machine learning models and training pipelines.

When not engaged in my research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, going to the gym, exploring the city of Montreal, playing board games with friends.  I'm also an avid reader of literary fiction, science fiction, and books about philosophy (especially ethics and metaphysics) and history.  I also occasionally paint minis.
