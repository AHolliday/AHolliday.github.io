I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at McGill University, supervised by professors Gregory Dudek and Ahmed El-Geneidy.  My PhD thesis is about training graph neural nets to plan public transit networks using reinforcement learning.  Prior to the PhD, I completed an M.Sc in computer science under Gregory Dudek, in which I developed a novel multi-level visual feature type for scene recognition and localization over long distances.  I have also spent time as a computer vision researcher at Samsung's Montreal AI lab, and at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo under professor Helmut Prendinger.  My research interests include computer vision, reinforcement learning, field robotics, graph neural networks, urban planning, AI alignment, and neural learning in general. 

Beyond my work in academia, I have spent time in industry: from 2017 to 2019 I was a machine learning consultant with Kinsol Research, working with them on several projects relating to visual object detection and time-series prediction.  There I curated datasets and designed and implemented machine learning models and training pipelines.

When not engaged in research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, exploring the city of Montreal, and playing board games with friends.  I'm also an avid reader of literary fiction, science fiction, philosophy (especially ethics and philosophy of mind) and history.
